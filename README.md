Fossilize is a Cydia tweak that allows you to run custom code upon pressing one of the two smart buttons on your Fossil Q smartwatch.  One of the custom actions is triggered by the "Commute Time" action, and the other one by "Ring Phone".

### Installation

To install it, you will need to have the Fossil app on your phone already.  Then you must implement Secret.mm to run whatever code you want (my implementation is not included in this public repo), and then compile.
